           The course proceeded over a semester, beginning with online programming of a robot, teaching points and familiarizing students with LIN, CIRC, spline and PTP motions.

           During the last module, students practiced with multi-axis milling in robot-master, a plugin for MasterCAM that supports path planning for custom robot cells.

During the last half of the semester, students developed their own processes, hacking existing tools and augmenting the robot with new capabilities.
