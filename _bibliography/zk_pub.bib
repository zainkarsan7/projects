	abstract = {Disassembly is an important strategy in achieving material circularity and closing the loop in material flow. While disassembly sequencing is heavily studied in manufacturing, few examples consider the constraints present in construction. To address this gap we propose a graph based method for disassembly sequencing with constraints on stability and internal stress. We test our algorithm on three frame structures of increasing complexity and element count using construction specific heuristics to determine source nodes and disassembly direction. Our algorithm can compute feasible disassembly sequences with sufficient speed to support applications in online robotic path planning.},
