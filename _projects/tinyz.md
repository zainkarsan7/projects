This machine was designed around low cost parts and sized in order to maximize working envelope, thereby permitting the greatest flexibility in machining. The choice to use predominantly aluminum profile made assembly very easy, and the machine extremely modular. 
A studio course was developed around this machine, in which students developed their own material processes by hacking the machine. More information on this course can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">here</a>

        Multi-axis variants were easy to implement with additional stepper motors. MasterCAM was used for the CAM workflow, GCode was streamed over CNCjs.
